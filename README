Link Community Transport is a non-profit organization who provides a service to the aging population of Melbourne Victoria.  They provide transport to shops and various other activities to assist the elderly and get them more social and active. They are run off a mix of full-time paid staff and volunteers who are mainly drivers. 

The Attendance System is needed for Link Community Transport, so they have a better way of tracking their drivers, in terms of a sign in/sign out functionality. This system helps a lot with currently administrative overhead by decreasing the overall workload because a lot of information is available in a form of a database instead of manually collecting and writing up papers. To the point of papers, this will allow for a decrease in overall environmental footprint that Link Community Transport outputs and lastly the information in the database is searchable, backup friendly and storable in ways that paper stored information is not.

The overall goal of the new system is to reduce administrative overhead at Link Community Transport. To achieve this, our system has to be easy to use by the drivers and the database must be able to work with the current infrastructure at Link Community Transport. The technology, hardware and software need to be carefully researched, designed, developed and implemented to provide Link Community Transport with a system that meets their requirements and is cost effective.
